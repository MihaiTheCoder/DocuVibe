# Presentation Design Guide - Living Apps Pitch

**Purpose**: Visual support for the 3-minute pitch. NOT a text-heavy deck.
**Style**: Minimal text, high visual impact, support the narrative.
**Total Slides**: 7

---

## Slide 1: Title

**Visual**:
- Dark background
- Hospital corridor or medical building (subtle, muted)
- Text overlaid

**Text**:
```
VibeDocs
Building Living Apps
```

**Notes**: Keep it simple. This is just the opener while you introduce yourself.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (Act 1)

**Visual**:
- Photo of overwhelmed office worker surrounded by stacks of papers/documents
- Hospital imagery in background (subtle)
- Slightly desaturated, conveys stress

**Text** (minimal):
```
Librimir, Resita Hospital
1000+ employees
Drowning in documents

Someone you love will go to a hospital
```

**Notes**: Combines the problem and personal stakes. The image shows chaos. His name + personal stakes in one slide.

---

## Slide 3: Cruel Gods (Act 2)

**Visual**:
- Gray/dark background
- User facing locked door or "access denied" screen
- Or: Single powerful image of barrier/gate

**Text**:
```
We are gods in our software worlds

CRUEL GODS
Can't change a color
Can't add a feature
Can't build anything
```

**Notes**: Combines "we are gods" with "cruel gods" - one uncomfortable punch. Let it land.

---

## Slide 4: The Power Spectrum (Act 3)

**Visual**:
- Simple horizontal spectrum graphic:
```
CHAOS ←──────────────────────→ DEAD
     (gravity)         (paint)

              ↓
        BEAUTIFUL
         GARDEN
```

**Text**:
```
If everyone can change gravity? → Collapses
If no one can even paint? → Dead

Good gods design power in a controlled manner
```

**Notes**: THE KEY SLIDE. Clean diagram, memorable visual. This is where you show sophistication.

---

## Slide 5: The Transformation (Act 3)

**Visual**:
- Before/After split OR transformation graphic:
  - BEFORE: User waiting, passive, outside
  - AFTER: User building, active, inside workspace
- Use arrows or animation transition

**Text**:
```
Remember your first software project?

What if Librimir had that power?

SUBJECT → CREATOR
```

**Notes**: The emotional beat. Visual should show the transformation.

---

## Slide 6: Monument vs Garden (Act 4)

**Visual**:
- Split screen:
  - LEFT: Stone monument, static, unchanging (Greek column or statue)
  - RIGHT: Living garden, vibrant, growing (flowers, trees, life)
- Bright, aspirational

**Text**:
```
EVANGELION - The Good News

MONUMENT          GARDEN
  Static    →    Living
   Dead     →     Alive
Finished    →    Growing
```

**Notes**: Combines vision with the core metaphor. Should be striking contrast, bright colors.

---

## Slide 7: The Question (Close)

**Visual**:
- Two paths diverging or choice point
- Or: Simple text on bold background
- Clean, direct

**Text** (large, centered):
```
What will your next project be?

A MONUMENT or A GARDEN?

Let's build the future.
[Your contact/website]
```

**Notes**: The final question + call to action. Let the question hang, then close with confidence.

## Design Principles

### Colors:
- **Act 1-2 (Problem/Cruel Gods)**: Grays, muted tones, constrained feeling
- **Act 3 (Power Spectrum)**: Neutral, clean, diagrammatic
- **Act 4 (Vision)**: Bright, vibrant, alive colors
- **Close**: Bold, clear

### Typography:
- **Sans-serif** (Helvetica, Arial, or similar)
- **Large text** - readable from back of room
- **Minimal bullet points** - 3-4 words per line max
- **Key phrases in bold**

### Images:
- **High quality** - no stock photo clichés
- **Real people** when possible (not posed corporate photos)
- **Emotional** - should make them feel something
- **Consistent style** - all photos similar tone/treatment

### Animations:
- **Minimal** - only to reveal key points
- **Simple transitions** - fade or slide
- **No bouncing/spinning** - keep it professional

## What to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Fill slides with paragraphs of text
❌ **Don't**: Use corporate stock photos (handshake, suit meeting)
❌ **Don't**: Put your full script on slides
❌ **Don't**: Use complex diagrams that need explaining
❌ **Don't**: Use more than 7-8 slides

✅ **Do**: Let images carry emotion
✅ **Do**: Use text as punctuation, not narration
✅ **Do**: Create visual contrast (problem → solution)
✅ **Do**: Make key phrases memorable and visible
✅ **Do**: Practice without the slides first

## Final Tips

**Before the Pitch**:
- Test slides on the actual projector/screen
- Make sure text is readable from back of room
- Have a backup (PDF on USB + cloud link)
- Practice with slide transitions

**During the Pitch**:
- Don't read the slides
- Use slides as triggers for your memory
- Pause on key slides (especially Slide 4 - Power Spectrum, and Slide 7 - The Question)
- Make eye contact, not screen contact

**The slides should support you, not replace you.**
